Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on
building systems that learn from data instead of being explicitly programmed.
ML algorithms identify patterns in historical data and use those patterns
to make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data.

Common examples include spam detection, recommendation systems, and
credit risk modeling.
