Deep Learning (DL) is a specialized area of Machine Learning that uses
neural networks with multiple hidden layers, known as deep neural networks.
These models are particularly effective for unstructured data such as images,
audio, and text.

Popular deep learning architectures include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).
